                                            Importantly the tractor blades faces the lot of stones and rock. There is a possibility for the blades to get damaged by the mineral obstacles(rocks) in his cores of action. This leads to the inefficiency of the procedure. Thereby requiring more effort and time than needed. In the residence agriculture is the most performed activity and they are facing inconvenience in ploughing. The hydrologic processes of rainfall and runoff play an essential role in water erosion. The amount and rate of surface runoff can affect erosion and sediment transport.

                                            It is used to remove the rock from the path.
                                            The rock repellent uses hydraulic forces to remove the obstacles.
                                            The Pascalâ€™s law applied here in the form of hydraulic.
                                            Being an agriculture relied region, people often use plough for ploughing to making it which stand lots of detriment .
                                            This project could save the time and expenses.

                                            It controls the crops damage and get more yield.
                                            This is the mainly concept for advanced ploughing.
                                            It is more efficiency in extra work.
                                            The advanced detecting system (SENSOR) detected the rocks and unidentified objects , then ploughing machine take out the rock and filter the soil.
